Lifesaver is a MODO kit for storing backups of your most important MODO preferences. It was originally developed by Mechanical Color LLC as a proprietary paid product, and is now released as open-source under the MIT license.

Since MODO's config files are notoriously corruptable, it is important to reset them on a regular basis. Lifesaver makes this much less painful by keeping backups of each of the most important preferences fragments, allowing you to reset your preferences with much less inconvenience. The backups are updated each time you quit modo, so you never need to explicitly save them. It's good.
